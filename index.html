                is a Michigan-based weekend school founded by Mrs. Purnima Gupta and Mrs. Krishna Patel in 2006. Although the need for extra-curricular mathematics training has been recognized, few organizations have been able to deliver quality and personalized guidance to the talented children and young adults who deserve it.  Some programs throw hundreds of problems at students with no direction; other groups' commercial interests outweigh the needs of the students.

                The truth is, some students find the math at their school to be mundane and they need something more challenging.  But some of these students are not interested in or are not ready for the alternative - the challenge of competitive math.  The EDEN center bridges the gap that exists between the structure of the student's school system and the problem solving required in the most difficult mathletics.  Instead of blindly jumping from the concepts of school work into fierce academic competitions, students at Eden can learn math subjects of higher grade levels or reinforce the concepts which will allow for success and confidence in any mathematical scenario.

                Students can use EDEN to help them test-out of those mundane classes at school or to make sure they have the fundamentals necessary to pursue top placements in MathCOUNTS or MMPC.</p>

                                <p class="description">Mrs. Gupta has been a teacher "as soon as she had kids."  Starting the Math Club at Smith Middle School in Troy, she was originally told that there would be no interest in such an organization.  One year later, she was making the administration eat their words when she took Smith's MathCOUNTS team to the State Competition.  The awards kept coming - Mrs. Gupta has made 4 teachers at Smith, including herself Edith Mae Slyfe Award winners, and has coached six students to the National level of MathCOUNTs. She herself has been named the state of Michigan's MathCOUNT's team coach twice.  She also has had an AJHSME (now the AMC 8) winner from her math club every year since she started.  Mrs. Gupta has been a teacher at the illustrious Indus Center for Academic Excellence for the past 7 years and has taught at Oakland University's Project Upward Bound for over 4 years.  What started as a pastime to keep her three boys busy has now made Mrs. Gupta a household name in the southeastern Michigan mathematical community.</p>

                                <p class="description">    Andrew Bird has been teaching the English/Language Arts classes at the EDEN Center for several years. He has a master’s degree in English from Oakland University, and his writing has been cited by Niels Herold, PhD, in Prison Shakespeare and the Purpose of Performance: Repentance Rituals and the Early Modern. As a student of Montessori education, Andrew believes that with enough grammar instruction and literary inspiration, any child is capable of thinking critically and writing creatively. His students have won essay contests, skipped grades, placed in Honors and AP English classes two grade levels above their age, and achieved perfect scores on standardized tests. An accomplished musician whose music has appeared on television shows such as ABC family’s The Fosters, Andrew has also been teaching guitar for nearly a decade and has helped students receive music scholarships from Wayne State University and the University of Michigan. </p>

                                <p class="description">Anish has been coaching students for over 5 years now.  He is young enough to remember what the tests are like, but old enough to have some experience under his belt.  He started teaching the verbal section through the Indus Center for Academic Excellence in 2001 and has been privately tutoring ever since.  Since then he has taught individualized classes in Troy, Novi, Canton, and Ann Arbor and can promise any dedicated student a score of over 2200.  Anish recently has been named the Director of Test Preparation for the upcoming Scholar Holler community.  His rigorous essay assessments, plentiful resources (including Real SAT exams), and take-no-prisoners attitude make him a more worthwhile choice than commercialized Test Prep centers.</p>
